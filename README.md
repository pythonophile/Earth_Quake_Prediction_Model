# Earthquake Prediction Model with Machine Learning

**Team:** ML Team Gamma  
**Project Title:** Earthquake Prediction Model with Machine Learning  

## Introduction
Earthquakes are devastating natural disasters that pose significant risks to life and property. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict earthquakes by utilizing diverse datasets, including seismic activity records, geological data, and environmental factors. The objective is to create a reliable and accurate prediction system that can assist in disaster preparedness and risk management.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection:** Gather and preprocess data related to seismic activities and geological and environmental factors.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns and correlations in the data using visualizations and statistical methods.
- **Model Development:** Train and validate machine learning models to predict earthquake occurrences and magnitudes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and validate its predictive accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with real-time earthquake predictions.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- **Sources:** USGS, Global Seismographic Network (GSN), and other geological data repositories.
- **Data Types:** Seismic activity records, historical earthquake data, geological fault lines, environmental factors (e.g., weather, soil moisture), and other relevant variables.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
- **Normalization:** Standardize numerical data and encode categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generate new features to improve the model, including time since the last earthquake, seismic depth, and fault line proximity.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization:** Use tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend, correlation, and distribution analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to uncover significant predictors.

### 4. Model Development
- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks
- **Training and Validation:** Split data into training and validation sets. Apply cross-validation for better generalizability.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.
- **Model Comparison:** Select the best model based on performance across these metrics.

### 6. Deployment
- **Dashboard Development:** Create a web-based dashboard using Flask or Django.
- **Visualization Tools:** Integrate Plotly or Bokeh for dynamic and interactive visualizations.
- **User Interaction:** Provide real-time predictions based on user-inputted data.

## Resources

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Flask/Django
